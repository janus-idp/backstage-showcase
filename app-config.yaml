proxy:
  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.

# Reference documentation http://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/configuration
# Note: After experimenting with basic setup, use CI/CD to generate docs
# and an external cloud storage when deploying TechDocs for production use-case.
