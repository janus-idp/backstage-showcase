# Building this repo as a container image

## Multi-arch support

RHDH is currently only available for amd64/x86_64. 

If you want an image that runs on Mac M1 (arm64/aarch64) or another architecture, you will need to build it yourself.

## Building locally

Check out this repo, choose the branch or tag you want to use, then build an image:

```
podman build -f docker/Dockerfile . -t janus-idp/backstage-showcase:local
```

## Downstream builds

Downstream dockerfile and configuration can be found here:

* link:../.rhdh/docker/[.rhdh/docker]

Downstream sources use the above folder to transform sources in this repo to something that can be built within the Red Hat build pipeline. 

*_Red Hat VPN access required._*

* https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhidp/rhdh

For more info on building downstream with the Red Hat build pipeline, see the docs.
