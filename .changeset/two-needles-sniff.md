'dynamic-plugins-imports': patch
---

bumped up RBAC plugin and dynamic-plugins-info plugin version

- fix to show 0 if no members in a group ([#1187](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/issues/1187))
- updates to use relative links and to add a property to help better integrate RBAC plugin and dynamic-plugins-info plugin into the backstage-showcase Administration page ([#1185](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/issues/1185))
- ensures the plugin configuration for dynamic-plugins-info is also exported when the package is released ([#1158](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-plugins/pull/1158))
