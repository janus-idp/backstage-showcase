# scalprum

Welcome to the scalprum backend plugin!

This plugin depends on the `backend-dynamic-feature-service` and
provides access to the scalprum manifest, as well as plugin assets,
of every dynamic frontend plugin installed in the dynamic plugins root folder.

It is used by the dynamic frontend plugin support in the frontend showcase application.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the backend app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start-backend` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/api/scalprum](http://localhost:7007/api/scalprum).
