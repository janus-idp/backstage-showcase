# dynamic-plugins-info

Welcome to the dynamic-plugins-info backend plugin!

This plugin depends on the `backend-dynamic-feature-service` and lists all the dynamic plugins installed in the dynamic plugins root folder.

## Getting started

This plugin has been added to the backend app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start-backend` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/api/dynamic-plugins-info](http://localhost:7007/api/dynamic-plugins-info).

To view the list of installed dynamic plugins, navigate to `http://localhost:7007/api/dynamic-plugins-info/loaded-plugins`
