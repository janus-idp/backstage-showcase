# Catalog Backend Module for Scaffolder Relation Catalog Processor

This is an extension module to the catalog-backend plugin, providing an additional catalog entity processor that adds a new relation that depends on the `spec.scaffoldedBy` field to link scaffolder templates and the catalog entities they generated.
