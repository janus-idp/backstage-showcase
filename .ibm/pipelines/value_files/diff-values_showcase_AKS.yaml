# This file is for AKS installation only. 
# It is applied by `helm upgrade` after the `values-showcase.yaml` is applied and only contains complementary differences for AKS.
# Note, that it overwrites the whole key that is present in this file. 
# The only exception is global.dynamic.plugins, that gets merged with the base file.
