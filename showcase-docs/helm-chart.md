This projects uses the Backstage Helm Chart. This Helm Chart is used to simplify the process of deploying the Backstage Showcase app to a Kubernetes cluster.

For more information on the Backstage Helm Chart consult the [official documentation](https://github.com/backstage/charts).

## Getting Started

Ensure that you have a current version of [Helm installed on your local machine](https://github.com/backstage/charts/tree/main/charts/backstage#prerequisites).

To install, see the [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Next is to add the Backstage Helm Chart and its dependent repository.

See [Backstage Helm Chart README](https://github.com/backstage/charts/tree/main/charts/backstage#tldr)

## Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

This guide will have a focus deploying to an OpenShift cluster as that is the main target for this project.

1. Build and push an image of the Backstage Showcase app that you can test.

   ```shell
   podman build -t <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . -f docker/Dockerfile
   podman push <registry>/<repository>:<tag>
   ```

2. Create a file to hold environment variables called `values-backstage-showcase.yaml` and populate it with the following content.

   ```yaml
   backstage:
     image:
       registry: <registry>
       repository: <repository>
       tag: <tag>
     extraEnvVars:
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_app_baseUrl'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_backend_baseUrl'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_backend_cors_origin'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'

   ingress:
     enabled: false
     host: localhost
   ```

   1. Environment variables using the prefix APP_CONFIG will override the default variables that are configured within the app-config.yaml file. Ensure to update the `<registry>` `<repository>` and `<tag>` fields to point to your image.

3. Deploy the Backstage Showcase app to the OpenShift cluster

   ```shell
   helm install -n backstage --create-namespace backstage backstage/backstage -f values-backstage-showcase.yaml
   ```

4. You can see confirm that the Backstage Showcase pod is running using the command

   ```shell
   oc get pods -n backstage
   ```

5. Finally forward the port to access the Backstage Showcase app

   ```shell
   oc port-forward -n backstage svc/backstage 7007:7007
   ```

   1. The app can be accessed at <http://localhost:7007>
