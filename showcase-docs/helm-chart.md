# Setting up to use the Helm Chart

The Helm Chart that this project is currently using is the Backstage Helm Chart. This Helm Chart is used to simplify the process of deploying the Backstage Showcase app to a Kubernetes cluster. For more information on the Backstage Helm Chart consult the [official documentation](https://github.com/backstage/charts).

## Getting Started

Ensure that you have Helm installed on your local machine, you can find out more information on the [Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Next is to add the Backstage Helm Chart and its dependent repository.

```shell
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add backstage https://backstage.github.io/charts
```

## Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

This guide will have a focus deploying to an OpenShift cluster as that is the main target for this project.

1. Build and push an image of the Backstage Showcase app that you can test.

   ```shell
   podman build -t <registry>/<repository>:<tag> . -f docker/Dockerfile
   podman push <registry>/<repository>:<tag>
   ```

2. Create a file to hold environment variables called `values-backstage-showcase.yaml` and populate it with the following content.

   ```yaml
   backstage:
     image:
       registry: <registry>
       repository: <repository>
       tag: <tag>
     extraEnvVars:
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_app_baseUrl'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_backend_baseUrl'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'
       - name: 'APP_CONFIG_backend_cors_origin'
         value: 'http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}:7007'

   ingress:
     enabled: false
     host: localhost
   ```

   1. Environment variables using the prefix APP_CONFIG will override the default variables that are configured within the app-config.yaml file. Ensure to update the `<registry>` `<repository>` and `<tag>` fields to point to your image.

3. Deploy the Backstage Showcase app to the OpenShift cluster

   ```shell
   helm install -n backstage --create-namespace backstage backstage/backstage -f values-backstage-showcase.yaml
   ```

4. You can see confirm that the Backstage Showcase pod is running using the command

   ```shell
   oc get pods -n backstage
   ```

5. Finally forward the port to access the Backstage Showcase app

   ```shell
   oc port-forward -n backstage svc/backstage 7007:7007
   ```

   1. The app can be accessed at <http://localhost:7007>
